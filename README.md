Web Based trainer for Windows

This project was created with the intention of teaching users about what to do to prevent viruses, malware, emails scams, etc. The goal of this project is to simulate a Windows environment as much as possible so that realistic scenarios / triggers can be added to teach a user how to deal with certain situations on their computer such as receiving a malicious looking email in their Outlook.
